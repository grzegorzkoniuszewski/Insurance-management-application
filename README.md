# INSURANCE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION

## Introduction

I wrote this project in a team of three participants of a Python programming course, who devoted a total of 42 hours to its implementation, in accordance with the time allocated for the course. The aim of the project is to create an application enabling the management of users' insurance policies, both motor and insurance.

## Requirements
```bash
#create a virtual environment for application libriaries in Windows OS:
#add Python interpreter
#activating hermetic environment

venv\Scripts\activate
pip  install  -r  requirements.txt
pip  list
```
Check: [tutorial venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
/ [djangoproject](https://www.djangoproject.com/) documentation

    ```

3. Install required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Perform database migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. Run the development server:

## Usage

The application is designed to facilitate the management of user insurance policies. Its features include:

1.  Adding, editing, and deleting user profiles.
2.  Adding, editing, and deleting insurance policies.
3.  Adding, editing, and deleting insurance companies.
4.  User panel functionality, including registration, login, and logout capabilities.



## Our application looks like this from the user's perspective:
1.Home page for those who do not have an account/users who are not logged in.

4.Home page for logged in users where you can fully manage and store data related to your current car insurance policies, those you will have in the future, or those purchased but not active due to the start date of insurance coverage.
The user also has the full ability to add cars and modify data related to them or set the car's status to "sold".
