# INSURANCE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop an application for managing user insurance policies, initially focusing on vehicle insurance. However, life insurance functionalities will be gradually added over time, along with other enhancements to the project.

This comprehensive solution, known as the Insurance Management Application, aims to provide users with a user-friendly interface to efficiently handle their insurance-related tasks.

The entire project was completed within a limited time frame of 42 hours as part of the "Final Project" block in the "Python from Scratch" course organized by Software Development Academy.
